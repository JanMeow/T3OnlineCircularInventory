"There are existing used materials platform in switzerland, however, the features are not useful for generating a design using these used materials from demolished buildings, material features also differe across platform and it lacks 3D model which is crucial for architectural design"

"To account for the current gap, a Web-based platform that allows users to search, browse, used building materials from lists of soon-to-be-demolished building under different creteria such as shape, dimensions, materiality, locationÂ´. etc, is developed. 
Original data are gathered through webscapping and certain ML methods, the platform could also be opned in common 3D design platform such as Rhino and grasshopper such that user can perform instant remapping between componenets from our database to the componenets that best matches their search result. This aims to automate/ streamline the design process with used materials, which is currently quite difficult and to promote sustainability in the construction sector"
